# Monday Fix - Deployment Validation Error Resolution

## Problem Summary
The deployment script was failing with a CloudFormation validation error:
```
An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the ValidateTemplate operation: At least one Resources member must be defined.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was a **template mismatch** between the repository and the deployed infrastructure:

- **Repository template**: Simplified version with basic functionality (13 resources)
- **Deployed infrastructure**: Enhanced version with file upload capabilities (27 resources)

The deployed stack included additional features:
- DynamoDB table for file registry
- S3 bucket for file uploads with CORS configuration
- S3 Lambda function for file operations
- Enhanced API Gateway endpoints
- Additional IAM permissions

## Fixes Applied

### 1. CloudFormation Template Sync (`infrastructure/cloudformation-template.yaml`)
- âœ… Added missing `DMGTFormFilesBucket` S3 bucket for file uploads
- âœ… Added missing `DMGTFormFileRegistryTable` DynamoDB table
- âœ… Added missing `DMGTFormS3Lambda` function for file operations
- âœ… Enhanced IAM role with DynamoDB permissions
- âœ… Added API Gateway resources for S3 and file registry endpoints
- âœ… Updated Lambda function code to match deployed versions
- âœ… Added proper CORS configuration for file uploads

### 2. Deploy Script Improvements (`deploy.sh`)
- âœ… Changed default region from `us-east-1` to `eu-west-2` 
- âœ… Changed default environment from `prod` to `dev`
- âœ… Added files bucket cleanup in destruction process
- âœ… Updated usage examples to reflect new defaults

## Verification
- âœ… Template now has 27 resources matching deployed infrastructure
- âœ… All required resource types present (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront, DynamoDB)
- âœ… Template size matches deployed version (~49KB)
- âœ… Deploy script defaults match current deployment configuration

## Testing
Run the deployment script to verify the fix:
```bash
./deploy.sh --environment=dev --verbose
```

The deployment should now:
1. âœ… Pass CloudFormation template validation
2. âœ… Successfully create/update the stack
3. âœ… Deploy without the "At least one Resources member must be defined" error

## Files Changed
- `infrastructure/cloudformation-template.yaml` - Synced with deployed infrastructure
- `deploy.sh` - Fixed region and environment defaults

## Next Steps
1. Test deployment on `monday_fix` branch
2. Merge to `main` if successful
3. Deploy to production environment when ready

## Impact
- ðŸ”§ **Fixes**: Deployment validation errors
- ðŸš€ **Enables**: Continued development and deployment
- ðŸ“ˆ **Maintains**: All existing functionality including file uploads
- âš¡ **Improves**: Developer experience with correct defaults
