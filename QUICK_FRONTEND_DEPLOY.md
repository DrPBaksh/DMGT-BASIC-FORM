# DMGT Basic Form - Quick Frontend Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Your Infrastructure is Already Working!

Your AWS stack `dmgt-basic-form-dev` is already deployed and running:
- ✅ **Status**: UPDATE_COMPLETE
- ✅ **API Gateway**: https://hfrcfsq0v6.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev
- ✅ **Website URL**: https://ddrixnaeqcnpz.cloudfront.net
- ✅ **All S3 buckets**: Ready

## 🚀 Deploy Frontend Only (Recommended)

Since your infrastructure is working, just deploy the frontend:

```bash
# Make sure you're on the fixed branch
git checkout pete_branch_v3

# Deploy frontend only (skips CloudFormation)
./deploy.sh --environment=dev --frontend-only --verbose
```

This will:
1. ✅ Install npm dependencies with fixes
2. ✅ Build React application  
3. ✅ Deploy to S3
4. ✅ Invalidate CloudFront cache
5. ✅ Your app will be live at: https://ddrixnaeqcnpz.cloudfront.net

## 🔧 Alternative: Fix Dependencies First

If you want to test the build process first:

```bash
# Fix npm dependencies 
chmod +x fix-dependencies.sh
./fix-dependencies.sh

# Then deploy frontend
./deploy.sh --environment=dev --frontend-only
```

## ⚠️ Skip Infrastructure Deployment

**Don't run full deployment** since your CloudFormation template has a parsing issue, but your infrastructure is already working perfectly.

The frontend-only deployment will use your existing:
- S3 buckets
- API Gateway
- CloudFront distribution
- Lambda functions

## 🎉 Expected Result

After frontend deployment:
- Your React app builds successfully
- Frontend uploads to S3
- CloudFront cache invalidates
- Website live at: https://ddrixnaeqcnpz.cloudfront.net
