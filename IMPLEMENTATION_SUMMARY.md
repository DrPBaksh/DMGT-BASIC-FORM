## 🔐 Security & Configuration

### AWS S3 Setup Required
```bash
# Environment Variables (.env.local)
REACT_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key-id
REACT_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
REACT_APP_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
```

### S3 Bucket Configuration

- **Directory Structure**: Automated company-based organization
- **Access Control**: Signed URLs for secure file access

## 📋 Backend Integration Requirements

### API Endpoint Enhancements Needed
```javascript
// POST /responses - Enhanced payload support:
{
  // Existing fields...
  fileMetadata: {
    questionId: string,
    fileName: string,
    fileSize: number,
    s3Key: string,
    s3Url: string
  },
  formState: 'new' | 'in_progress' | 'completed',
  completionPercentage: number,
  lastModified: ISO timestamp
}

// GET /responses - Enhanced response:
{
  // Existing fields...
  companyInProgress: boolean,
  completionPercentage: number,
  lastModified: timestamp,
  canModify: boolean
}
```
