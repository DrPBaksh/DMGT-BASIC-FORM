## 🛠 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Workflow Logic (Exactly as Requested)**

1. **Home Screen:**
   - Enter Company ID
   - System checks completion status
   - Shows "Amend" if completed, "Start" if not completed

2. **Company Form:**
   - 3 sections with manual save buttons
   - NO auto-save functionality
   - Saves to S3: `{companyId}/company.json`
   - Each save overwrites previous JSON

3. **Employee Forms:**
   - List of previous employee IDs
   - "Start New Form" generates unique ID and displays it
   - "Finish Returning Form" requires employee ID entry
   - Saves to S3: `{companyId}/employee_{employeeId}.json`
   - Each save overwrites previous JSON

### **Modern UI Features**

- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear navigation and progress indicators
- **Space Efficiency:** Grid layouts maximize screen real estate
- **Accessibility:** Proper contrast ratios and semantic markup
- **Professional Appearance:** Modern gradients, shadows, and typography

### **S3 Storage Structure**
```
dmgt-basic-form-responses-dev-530545734605/
├── {companyId}/
│   ├── company.json           # Company form data
│   ├── employee_0.json        # First employee
│   ├── employee_1.json        # Second employee
│   └── employee_n.json        # Additional employees
```

## 🚀 **Current Status & Next Steps**

### **✅ Completed Components**
1. ✅ Frontend application with exact workflow logic
2. ✅ Modern responsive UI design
3. ✅ Simplified package.json
4. ✅ Updated CloudFormation infrastructure
5. ✅ Deployment scripts
6. ✅ All code committed to GitHub

### **⚠️ Infrastructure Status**
- **S3 Buckets:** ✅ Already exist and accessible
  - `dmgt-basic-form-config-dev-530545734605`
  - `dmgt-basic-form-responses-dev-530545734605` 
  - `dmgt-basic-form-website-dev-530545734605`

### **📋 Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload to S3:**
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync build/ s3://dmgt-basic-form-website-dev-530545734605/ --delete
   ```

3. **Update API URL:**
   - The frontend currently points to a placeholder API URL
   - Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` in `.env.production` with actual API Gateway URL

### **🔧 Backend Requirements**

The frontend expects these API endpoints:
- `GET /company-status/{companyId}` - Check company form status
- `GET /employee-list/{companyId}` - Get employee list
- `GET /employee-data/{companyId}/{employeeId}` - Get employee data
- `POST /save-company` - Save company form data
- `POST /save-employee` - Save employee form data
