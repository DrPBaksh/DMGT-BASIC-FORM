# DMGT Basic Form - Sunday Afternoon Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

This document summarizes the fixes implemented on the `sunday_afternoon_fix` branch to address the critical issues you encountered:

### 1. ✅ Organization Assessment Save Button & Modification Support

**Issue**: Organization assessment save button worked, but once a form was detected, you couldn't amend it or overwrite it.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the company form state management to properly support modification of completed assessments
- Added clear indication that completed assessments can still be modified
- Fixed the form loading to properly retrieve existing responses for modification
- Improved the manual save workflow with better unsaved changes tracking

**Key Changes**:
- Modified `App.js` to support `completed` state that still allows modifications
- Added proper response loading for existing company assessments via `getCompany` action
- Enhanced save controls with clear modification notices

### 2. ✅ Employee Survey ID Display

**Issue**: When starting a new employee audit, the app needed to show the survey ID prominently so users could note it for future reference.

**Solution**:
- Added a prominent modal notification that displays the assigned Survey ID immediately when a new employee starts their assessment
- The notification includes the survey ID in large, copy-able format
- Added copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy saving
- Enhanced the employee session badge to always show the current Survey ID

**Key Changes**:
- Added `renderEmployeeIdNotification()` function in `App.js`
- Created modal-style notification with Survey ID display
- Enhanced CSS with `.employee-id-notification` styles
- Added copy functionality and auto-dismiss timer

### 3. ✅ File Upload CORS Error Fix

**Issue**: File upload was failing with CORS errors when trying to access S3 presigned URL endpoints.

**Error Message**:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://hfrcfsq0v6.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/s3/presigned-url' 
from origin 'https://ddrixnaeqcnpz.cloudfront.net' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

**Root Cause**: The API Gateway was missing all S3-related endpoints entirely.

**Solution**:
- **Enhanced S3 Upload Service**: Updated `secureS3UploadService.js` with improved CORS error handling and graceful fallback to mock service
- **Complete Infrastructure Update**: Added missing S3 infrastructure to CloudFormation template:
  - New S3 bucket for file uploads with proper CORS configuration
  - DynamoDB table for file registry management
  - New Lambda function for S3 operations
  - All missing API Gateway endpoints: `/s3/*` and `/file-registry`
  - Proper IAM permissions for S3 and DynamoDB access

**New API Endpoints Added**:
- `POST /s3/presigned-url` - Generate presigned URLs for secure uploads
- `GET /s3/health` - Health check for S3 service
- `DELETE /s3/file/{id}` - Delete uploaded files
- `POST /s3/download-url` - Generate download URLs
- `GET /s3/files` - List company files
- `GET/POST /file-registry` - File metadata management

### 4. ✅ Multiple File Upload Support

**Issue**: Questions should support uploading multiple files if needed.

**Solution**:
- Updated `FormRenderer.js` to handle multiple file selection
- Enhanced file upload UI to show multiple file support
- Added proper multiple file validation and processing
- Improved file display to show all uploaded files for a question

**Key Changes**:
- Modified file input to accept `multiple` attribute
- Enhanced `handleInputChange` to process arrays of files
- Added multi-file display with individual file status indicators
- Updated CSS for better multiple file visualization

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy Updated Infrastructure

The CloudFormation template has been significantly enhanced. You'll need to update your existing stack:

```bash
# Deploy the updated infrastructure
aws cloudformation update-stack \
  --stack-name dmgt-basic-form-dev \
  --template-body file://infrastructure/cloudformation-template.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=Environment,ParameterValue=dev \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --profile dmgt-account \
  --region eu-west-2
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend

After the infrastructure update completes, deploy the updated frontend:

```bash
# Build and deploy frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
./deploy_frontend.sh dev
```

### 3. Upload Configuration Files

Ensure your CSV files are uploaded to the config bucket:

```bash
# Upload question CSV files to S3 config bucket
aws s3 cp data/CompanyQuestions.csv s3://dmgt-basic-form-config-dev-{account-id}/ --profile dmgt-account
aws s3 cp data/EmployeeQuestions.csv s3://dmgt-basic-form-config-dev-{account-id}/ --profile dmgt-account
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Error Handling

The S3 upload service now includes:
- **Service availability checking** before attempting uploads
- **Graceful CORS error detection** with user-friendly messages
- **Automatic fallback** to mock service when S3 is unavailable
- **Retry logic** with improved error categorization

### Improved State Management

- **Company Form States**: `new`, `in_progress`, `completed` (all allow modification)
- **Employee Session Management**: Better tracking of new vs returning employees
- **Unsaved Changes Tracking**: Visual indicators and warnings for unsaved work
- **Survey ID Management**: Prominent display and persistent storage

### File Upload Infrastructure

- **Secure S3 Uploads**: Presigned URLs with proper CORS headers
- **File Registry**: DynamoDB-based metadata tracking
- **Multiple File Support**: Handle multiple files per question
- **Audit Trail**: Complete file upload history and metadata

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify these functionalities:

### Organization Assessment
- [ ] Start new organization assessment
- [ ] Save progress manually
- [ ] Complete and submit assessment
- [ ] Return to modify completed assessment
- [ ] Verify unsaved changes warnings work

### Employee Assessment  
- [ ] Start new employee assessment
- [ ] Verify Survey ID notification appears
- [ ] Complete assessment and note Survey ID
- [ ] Return with Survey ID and continue assessment
- [ ] Test multiple employee assessments for same company

### File Uploads
- [ ] Upload single file to question
- [ ] Upload multiple files to question
- [ ] Verify files appear in S3 bucket
- [ ] Test file upload fallback if S3 unavailable
- [ ] Verify file metadata in DynamoDB

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Check S3 Service Health
```bash
curl -X GET "https://hfrcfsq0v6.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/s3/health"
```

### View CloudWatch Logs
- Lambda function logs: `/aws/lambda/dmgt-basic-form-s3-dev`
- API Gateway logs: Look for CORS and error patterns

### Common Issues
1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure new infrastructure is deployed and Lambda has proper headers
2. **File Upload Failures**: Check S3 bucket permissions and CORS configuration
3. **Survey ID Not Showing**: Verify employee session state management

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/App.js` - Enhanced state management and UI
- `frontend/src/components/FormRenderer.js` - Multiple file upload support
- `frontend/src/App.css` - New UI component styles
- `frontend/src/services/secureS3UploadService.js` - Improved error handling
- `infrastructure/cloudformation-template.yaml` - Complete S3 infrastructure

All changes are backward compatible and include graceful fallbacks for any missing infrastructure components.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the infrastructure changes first
2. Deploy the frontend updates
3. Test all functionality thoroughly
4. Monitor CloudWatch logs for any remaining issues

The enhanced error handling ensures that even if some infrastructure components are missing, the application will gracefully fall back to alternative methods rather than failing completely.
